# Checker Champ

## Description

This Checkerboard and gamepiece framework will be utilized as an example with abstracted and reusable code for game-frame implementation. Eventually, this game may be playable. For now, I am creating a grid that has pieces that allows implementation of behaviors such as hover events, mouse events, drag and drop, etc.
